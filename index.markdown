# Investigating physical/biological interactions in the ocean

I am Lecturer at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, working between the [Institute of Marine Science](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/about-the-faculty/institute-of-marine-science.html) and the [School of Biological Sciences](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/about-the-faculty/school-of-biological-sciences.html), where I divide my time between teaching and research. My focus is on investigating how organisms and ecosystems are affected by the ocean's dynamic environment. I am particularly interested on physical/biological interactions at spatio-temporal scales ranging from few to hundreds of kilometers and a few hours to months. I am excited to learn how our understanding of these interactions can help us design conservation and management policies that fit the dynamic nature of coastal and open ocean regions.
